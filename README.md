# adventofcode2019
Advent of Code is a coding challenge that takes place every December where for each day until the 25th a new challenge is released. There are both global and private leaderboards and the scoring is solely based on how quickly you could send in the correct answer to their website. 

2019 me and some colleagues all took part of the challenge.

See [Advent of Code's 2019 website](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about) for more info.
